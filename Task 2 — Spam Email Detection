## 2) Data Loading and Processing + Train/Test Split (70/30)

### Data loading and feature/label selection
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

df = pd.read_csv("b_babalashvili25_34521.csv")

X = df[["words", "links", "capital_words", "spam_word_count"]]
y = df["is_spam"].astype(int)
