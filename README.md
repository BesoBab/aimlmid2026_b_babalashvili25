### Scatter Plot with Trend Line

In addition to the scatter plot, a linear trend line was added using least-squares regression.  
The trend line represents the best-fitting straight line through the data points.

The downward slope of the trend line visually confirms the **very strong negative linear relationship** between the variables. This graphical result is consistent with the computed Pearson correlation coefficient (**r ≈ −0.97**).
