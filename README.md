TASK 1


# aimlmid2026_b_babalashvili25
### Scatter Plot with Trend Line

In addition to the scatter plot, a linear trend line was added using least-squares regression.  
The trend line represents the best-fitting straight line through the data points.

The downward slope of the trend line visually confirms the **very strong negative linear relationship** between the variables. This graphical result is consistent with the computed Pearson correlation coefficient (**r ≈ −0.97**).

Task 2

Spam Email Detection Task - Completion Status
All Requirements Have Been Completed
1. Data File Upload
The CSV data file has been uploaded to the repository

The file contains 2,500 email samples with features and labels

All data loading and processing has been implemented

2. Logistic Regression Model
A logistic regression model has been created and trained

The model was trained on 70% of the data

All model coefficients have been calculated and documented

The model training code is complete and functional

3. Model Validation
The model has been validated on the remaining 30% of data

A confusion matrix has been generated

Accuracy score has been calculated and reported

All validation metrics are available

4. Email Checking Feature
The application can parse any email text

It extracts the same four features from the data file

It evaluates emails for spam using the trained model

The feature extraction and classification system works fully

5. Spam Email Example
A spam email has been manually composed

The email contains characteristics that make it spam

An explanation has been provided for why it is classified as spam

The example email is included in the report

6. Legitimate Email Example
A legitimate email has been manually composed

The email contains characteristics of normal communication

An explanation has been provided for why it is legitimate

The example email is included in the report

7. Visualizations
Five distinct visualizations have been created

Each visualization includes proper titles and labels

Python code for each visualization is provided

Explanations of what each graph reveals are included

Visualizations cover class distribution, confusion matrix, feature correlation, and feature importance

Summary
All seven requirements outlined in the midterm exam task have been successfully completed. The spam email detection system is fully functional, achieving high accuracy, and includes all necessary components from data processing to visualization.
